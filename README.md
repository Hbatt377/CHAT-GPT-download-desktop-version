**This is an unofficial project solely intended for personal learning and research. Since the ChatGPT desktop application was open-sourced, it has garnered a lot of attention, and I want to thank everyone for their support. However, as the project progressed, two issues have arisen that greatly impact its future development:**

- **Some individuals have repackaged and sold it for profit.**
- **The name and icon of ChatGPT could potentially lead to infringement disputes.**
